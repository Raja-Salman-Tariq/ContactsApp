# PhoneSummarizer - Access different types of data on your phone.

Objective of this app is to read various content provided by apps including the App Manager, Contacts, and Phone apps. The app sorts and filters numbers alphabetically according to network provider codes. It involves formatting and reformatting of phone numbers for proper cataloguing. The app maintains its own table of information as well which then checks against the phone's local data to determine whether a refresh is needed to cater to stale data. The Phone numbers can be shared to other apps and can also be backed on to Google Drive (google drive integrated).

This app is an experimental app with the following features:
- Drawer Layout with integration Navigation / Jetpack Navigation, Material UI Design and guidelines
- MVVM architecture, Live Data, Application / Data Provider class
- Content Provider classes and schemas used to access phone Contacts, Call Logs, Storage, Installed Applications
- File sharing using Share Sheet to share files in various apps
- SearchView widget, extensive searching and filtering, pagination (Using Paging Library as well as manual attempt based off LiveData), sorting.
- App Data BackUp - Google Drive, Local Storage, Local Database
